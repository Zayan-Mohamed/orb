- Scrolling remains smooth
- All files shown in list

### Large Files

When downloading large files:

- Download progress not shown (yet)
- Browser may appear frozen
- Wait for completion message

**Tip:** For very large files, consider using a download manager or resumable protocol in future versions.

### Network Latency

On slow connections:

- Directory listings take longer
- File downloads are slower
- Connection may timeout

**Tip:** Keep connection active, avoid network interruptions.

## Troubleshooting

### Browser Won't Open

```
Error: failed to load directory
```

**Causes:**

- Connection failed
- Handshake incomplete
- Permission denied

**Solutions:**

- Check connection logs
- Verify credentials
- Ensure share is active

### Cannot Download File

```
Error: download failed
```

**Causes:**

- File not readable
- Permission denied
- Network interruption
- Disk full

**Solutions:**

- Check file permissions on sharer
- Verify disk space
- Test network connection
- Try smaller file first

### Frozen Interface

**Causes:**

- Large file download in progress
- Network timeout
- Terminal too small

**Solutions:**

- Wait for operation to complete
- Press Ctrl+C to cancel
- Resize terminal window
- Check network connectivity

### Display Issues

**Causes:**

- Terminal doesn't support colors
- Terminal too small
- Unicode not supported

**Solutions:**

- Use modern terminal (iTerm2, Alacritty, Windows Terminal)
- Resize to at least 80x24
- Enable UTF-8 support

## Tips and Tricks

### 1. Terminal Size

For best experience:

- Minimum: 80 columns × 24 rows
- Recommended: 120 columns × 30 rows
- Wide terminals show more files

### 2. Download Organization

```bash
# Create session-specific download directory
mkdir -p ~/Downloads/session-$(date +%Y%m%d)
cd ~/Downloads/session-$(date +%Y%m%d)
orb connect --session <ID> --passcode <CODE>
```

### 3. Quick Navigation

```bash
# Navigate efficiently
# Use ↓↓↓ or jjj to move down quickly
# Press Enter to open
# Backspace to go back
```

### 4. Batch Operations

```bash
# For bulk downloads, script it (future feature)
# Current: manual download each file
```

## Security Considerations

### File Verification

After download, verify:

```bash
# Check file size
ls -lh downloaded-file.pdf

# Verify with checksum (if available)
sha256sum downloaded-file.pdf
```

### Safe Downloads

- Download to isolated directory
- Scan for malware if needed
- Verify file type
- Check file permissions

### Privacy

- File names visible in browser
- Directory structure revealed
- Consider data sensitivity
